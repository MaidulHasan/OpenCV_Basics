## OpenCV Basics

### Resources used

  - https://docs.opencv.org/4.7.0/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html
  - Other resources used for specific topics are listed in the respective notebooks
  
### Topics Covered
1. Various color spaces and color space conversion in OpenCV
2. How OpenCV stores images, reading in images, displaying and writting/saving images
3. Working with videos: how to read in video files, how to capture video with camera etc.
4. Drawing different shapes on images (rectangle, line, circle etc) and putting text on images
5. Arithmatic and Bitwise operations on images
6. Image transformations (translation, resizing, scaling, cropping etc.)
7. Noise in images (adding artificial noises, image denoising)
8. Morphological transformations
9. Image thresholding (separating an object as foreground from an image)
10. Edge detection 
11. Contours (finding and drawing contours, important contour properties and features, contour approximation etc.)
12. Perspective transformation
13. Image histograms (finding and plotting image histograms, histogram equalization)
14. Template matching
15. Hough transform (hough line and hough circle detection)
16. Image masking
17. Taking inputs from mouse/touchpad
18. Creating and monitoring trackbars

### Projects
1. VisionMeasure: Object Dimension Measurement with OpenCV (https://github.com/MaidulHasan/VisionMeasure)
2. DrawBoard: A Digital Balckboard (like Google Jamboard but much simpler) (https://github.com/MaidulHasan/DrawBoard)
